## Share data across component

### Define a new component namely Person, it will share data with Count

### You need to write `reducer`, `action`, and `constant` for Person component
 
### ATTENTION: the reducers between Counte and Person need to be merged by `combineReduces`, so the total state will be a Object

### And so, the store receives a total reducers, so you need to pick particular state in particular components
